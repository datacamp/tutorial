# tutorial

`knitr` utility to convert your static code chunks into an R editor where people can experiment. Powered by [DataCamp Light](https://www.github.com/datacamp/datacamp-light), a lightweight version of DataCamp's learning interface.

## Installing the package

Latest released version from CRAN

```R
install.packages("tutorial")
```

Latest development version from GitHub:

```R
if(!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("datacamp/tutorial")
```

## Getting started

Add the following chunk at the top of your R Markdown document

    ```{r, include=FALSE}
    tutorial::go_interactive()
    ```

Knit your document: in RStudio, simply hit "Knit HTML", or use

```R
rmarkdown::render("path_to_my_file", output_format = "html_document")
```

## How it works

R vignettes, blog posts and teaching material are typically standard web pages generated with R markdown. DataCamp has developed a framework to make this static content interactive: R code chunks are converted into an R-session backed editor so readers can experiment.

### Fiddles

If you render an R Markdown document like this:   

    ---
    title: "Example Document"
    author: "Your name here"
    output:
      html_document:
        self_contained: false
    ---

    ```{r, include=FALSE}
    tutorial::go_interactive()
    ```
    
    By default, `tutorial` will convert all R chunks.

    ```{r}
    a <- 2
    b <- 3

    a + b
    ```

An HTML file results that features an in-browser R editor with a session attached to it, where you can experiment.

Notice that the option `self_contained: false` is used. That way, always the latest version of the DataCamp Light JS library is fetched when the document is opened. If `self_contained: true`, the version of the JS library at 'knit time' is baked into the HTML document. This can cause backwards compatibility issues.

### Coding challenges

You can also embed coding challenges into your webpages. This group of code chunks:

    ```{r ex="create_a", type="pre-exercise-code"}
    b <- 5
    ```
    
    ```{r ex="create_a", type="sample-code"}
    # Create a variable a, equal to 5
    
    
    # Print out a
    
    ```
    
    ```{r ex="create_a", type="solution"}
    # Create a variable a, equal to 5
    a <- 5
    
    # Print out a
    a
    ```
    
    ```{r ex="create_a", type="sct"}
    test_object("a")
    test_output_contains("a", incorrect_msg = "Make sure to print `a`.")
    success_msg("Great!")
    ```
    
Converts to the following DataCamp Light exercise:

### Vignettes

You can power your package's vignettes with DataCamp Light by adding the same line to the top of your vignette:

    ---
    title: "Tutorial Basics"
    author: "Filip Schouwenaars"
    date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
    output: rmarkdown::html_vignette
    vignette: >
      %\VignetteIndexEntry{Tutorial Basics}
      %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
      %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
    ---

    ```{r, include=FALSE}
    tutorial::go_interactive()
    ```
    
    _remainder of vignette omitted_

## Python

You can also code up Python exercises with `tutorial`:

    ---
    title: "Example Document"
    author: "Your name here"
    output:
      html_document:
        self_contained: false
    ---

    ```{r, include=FALSE}
    tutorial::go_interactive()
    ```
    
    Here's an example of a Python fiddle/

    ```{python}
    a = 2
    b = 3

    print(a + b)
    ```
